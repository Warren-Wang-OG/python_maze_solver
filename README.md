# Maze Generation and Solve Visualization
### Last Update: 01/02/2023
Run main.py with python 3.10.x or higher. No additional packages from pip or conda required.

UI is through the command line with a floating GUI for visuals. Currently in progress of adding more maze solving algorithms.

## Algorithms
- **Depth First Search**: both generation and one solve method
- **Breadth First Search**: one solve method (find paths, backtrack to get shortest path)
- **Wall Follower (Right Hand Rule)**: one solve method
