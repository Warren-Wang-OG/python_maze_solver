# Maze Generation and Solve Visualization

## Getting Started
Run main.py with python 3.10.x or higher. No additional packages from pip or conda required.

Alternatively just download the [release]() and run the portable version for Windows made using `pyinstaller main.py --windowed`.

## Algorithms
- **Depth First Search**: both generation and one solve method
- **Breadth First Search**: one solve method (find paths, backtrack to get shortest path)
- **Wall Follower (Right Hand Rule)**: one solve method
